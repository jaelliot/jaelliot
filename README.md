# Welcome to Jay Alexander Elliot's GitHub Profile!

Hi there! I'm Jay, a tech enthusiast interested in Linux, cyber security, and the fascinating world of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). My journey in the tech world is guided by curiosity and a relentless drive to understand how things work at their core.

## What I'm Up To

- 🔭 I'm currently bootstrapping my mental health startup's platform. We're building a service that aims to reduce the suicide rate.
- 🌱 Currently, I'm currently learning Golang, and Nim, and refining my skills in Kubernetes. I'm also developing a game as a personal hobby project.
- 💼 I'm looking for opportunities to collaborate on projects related to **BCIs** and **game development**. Right now, BCIs are where personal computers were in the 1980s. I'm eager to jump into this field before the rush.
- I have a personal interest in the outdoors and fitness.

## Let's Connect and Collaborate
