Hi there! I'm Jay, a tech enthusiast interested in Linux, cyber security, and the fascinating world of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). My journey in the tech world is guided by curiosity and a relentless drive to understand how things work at their core.

## What I'm Up To

- üî≠ **Mental Health Startup**: I'm currently helping a family member bootstrap a platform that provides support and resources for mental health to contribute to suicide prevention. Our mission is to offer accessible help and foster a community where individuals can find the support they need during difficult times.
- üå± **Learning and Development**: I'm diving into Golang and Nim while honing my Kubernetes skills. Additionally, I'm working on a hobby project in game development, combining my passion for coding and creativity.
- üíº **BCI and Game Development**: I'm looking for opportunities to collaborate on projects related to brain-computer interfaces and game development. I believe BCIs are at the cutting edge of technology, much like personal computers were in the 1980s, and I'm eager to be a part of this exciting field as it evolves.
- I have a personal interest in the outdoors and fitness.
